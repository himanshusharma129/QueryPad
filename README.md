## Introduction

QueryPad is a mock application built as part of an interview task for Atlan. It simulates the experience of running SQL queries, viewing data, saving queries, and searching table attributes.

## Problem Statement Outline
>  The task involved creating, designing, and implementing a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying their results. The application needed to include a space for users to input SQL queries, execute them, and visualize the outcomes within the application.

Considerations
- The application is a mockup.
- It should feature a space for inputting SQL queries.
- No backend, query engine, or syntax validation was required.
- The displayed data could be arbitrary.
- The application must have multiple queries accompanied by respective data tables.
- Data and queries do not need to be synchronized.
- Designed for data analysts' use with all necessary features.

## Data 
QueryPad fetches data from [here](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv "here"). Upon initialization, CSV files from the provided link are downloaded, data extracted, converted, and stored in a .js file for ease of access and use.

## Features
The app has 2 sections, the left sidebar and the editor on the right.

#### Left Sidbar
1. Displays available tables and their attributes.
2. Enables attribute search through an input field.
3. Contains a section for saved queries.
4. Supports searching saved queries by their text.
5. Can be resized to an extent using a draggable divider

#### Editor pane
1. Includes an input field for SQL queries.
2. Features a run button next to the input field for executing queries.
3. Provides a button to save queries.
4. Offers a download button to retrieve all table data.
5. Utilizes virtualization for rendering large tables efficiently.

#### Dark Mode
QueryPad supports a theme switch button to toggle between light and dark themes.

#### Mocked Features (Not Implemented)
1. Source selector: Simulates selecting the data source.
2. Edit query name: Simulates query naming.
3. Login: A potential feature for personalizing the application for users.

## Optimisations

QueryPad meets web performance standards, with a TTI of 0.45s and zero cumulative layout shift.
The app also meets the Progressive Web App (PWA) requirements and can be installed and used offline.

### 1. Page Load Time
1. Initially, Monaco editor was used as SQL Input. But this brought alot of page time load delay. Also there was a lot of unused css with it which was reducing the performance metric. So, replaced the Monaco editor with simple input field.
2. Implemented react-virtualized Table for efficient rendering of table rows.
3. Minimized dependencies for improved performance.

### 2. Responsiveness and UX
1. Employed react-splitter-layout for resizable panes, enhancing user experience.
2. The website has been optimized for responsiveness, despite the fact that it's unlikely to be accessed frequently on mobile devices. `min-width` is used to give the table some space to show the columns with a scroll.
3. Hosted the website on Vercel for fast loading times, CDN benefits, caching, and SSL security.

### 3. Best Practices
1. Developed in `TypeScript` with defined types for enhanced code readability and prevention of runtime errors.
2. Adopted a design system utilizing CSS variables throughout the application
3. Created generic components for commonly used elements like buttons and text, allowing easy styling and overrides.
4. Utilized styled-components for clear, type-safe, and classname-free CSS management.
5. Exclusively used React functional components for improved code readability.


## Dependencies used
The app is build using ReactJs framework alongwith [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript").

<strong>External libraries used</strong>
1. [react-splitter-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-splitter-layout "react-splitter-layout")
